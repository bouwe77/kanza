# Kanza

## Kanza?

> _"Kanza, at the time of the ripening"_

A metaphor for being ready or reaching a finished state, from the [Star Trek - The Next Generation episode "Darmok"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kanza)

In the fictional Tamarian language, the word _"Kanza"_ refers to the moment a process is fully grown and ready to use—much like a terminal environment that has finished loading and is waiting for your command.
