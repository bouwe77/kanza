# Kanza

**A lightweight, customizable terminal emulator component for React.**

## Kanza?

> _"Kanza, at the time of the ripening"_

A metaphor for being ready or reaching a finished state, from the [Star Trek - The Next Generation episode "Darmok"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kanza)

In the fictional Tamarian language, the word _"Kanza"_ refers to the moment a process is fully grown and ready to use—much like a terminal environment that has finished loading and is waiting for your command.

## Getting started

```
npm i kanza
```

## Usage

Import the `Kanza` component into your React application:

```ts
import { Kanza } from 'kanza'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <Kanza />
    </div>
  )
}
```
